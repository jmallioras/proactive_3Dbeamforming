# Training Transformers and RNNs to forecast future DoAs

Using the dataset with DoA trajectories created in step 1, we intend to train and evaluate different types of neural networks (NNs) for the task in hand. 

### Step 1: Data preparation
This is 
### Step 2: Configuring the NN designs

### Step 3: Training and evaluating the NNs
